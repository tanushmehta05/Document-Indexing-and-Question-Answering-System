# Document Indexing and Question Answering System
 Built a document indexing and question-answering system using Pinecone for vector indexing and OpenAI API for natural language processing. ● Implemented document preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stop word removal, and punctuation removal using NLTK. ● Utilized TF-IDF vectorization for document indexing, allowing efficient retrieval of relevant documents based on user queries. ● Integrated Pinecone for fast vector indexing, enabling real-time querying of large text corpora. ● Developed a user interface for querying using Python, providing a seamless experience for users to ask questions and receive relevant answers from indexed documents. ● Implemented error handling and validation to ensure robustness and reliability of the system during user interactions.
